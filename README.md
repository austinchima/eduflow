4. **Deploy:**
   - Connect your repo to Netlify and follow the prompts.

### Backend (Node.js/Express) on Render

1. **Create a new Web Service** on Render, pointing to the `server/` directory.
2. **Build Command:** `npm install`
3. **Start Command:** `node index.js` (or `npm start` if you have a start script)
